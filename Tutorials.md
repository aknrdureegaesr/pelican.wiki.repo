If you have published a Pelican-related tutorial on your own site, please create a link to your tutorial on this page.

- The [Pelican installation screencast](http://hackercodex.com/guide/pelican-static-site-generator-install/) provides a visual guide to installing and configuring Pelican.

- Matt Makai published an excellent [introductory tutorial](https://www.fullstackpython.com/blog/generating-static-websites-pelican-jinja2-markdown.html) at Full Stack Python.

- **Firebase Hosting**: Continuous Build and Deployment every time you do `git push` to the *forever-free tier Firebase* using a [step by step tutorial](https://cloudbytes.dev/articles/auto-deploy-pelican-websites-to-firebase-hosting).

- **GitHub Pages**: The Pelican docs have a [guide for this](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/tips.html).  This step by step guide to automatically publish to [GitHub Pages directly using GitHub Actions](https://cloudbytes.dev/articles/automate-deployment-of-pelican-website-to-github-pages) by pushing your commits is intended to accomplish the same thing, but is fraught with pitfalls and outdated information and code.

- You can also [use Travis-CI to publish to GitHub Pages](http://zonca.github.io/2013/09/automatically-build-pelican-and-publish-to-github-pages.html), allowing you to publish your site simply by pushing your commits to GitHub (without generating locally or using your own VPS).

- As another deployment option, you can [deploy your site to Heroku](http://blog.getpelican.com/using-pelican-with-heroku.html).

- It's possible to [create "Linked List" posts](https://gist.github.com/jsonbecker/7539951) that behave differently from standard posts.

Welcome to the Pelican wiki!

## Getting Started

For information on the current release version, please refer to the [Pelican documentation](http://docs.getpelican.com/).
For those using the bleeding-edge version, refer to the corresponding [in-development documentation](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/). Third-party [tutorials](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/wiki/Tutorials) are also available.

Additional themes can be found in the [Pelican Themes](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes) repository. Plugins and tools for Pelican be found in the [Pelican Plugins](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins) repository and on the [[Externally hosted Plugins and Tools]] page.

## Getting Help

If you have any problems, questions, or suggestions, please start by striking up a conversation on [#pelican on irc.freenode.org](irc://irc.freenode.net/pelican). Those who don't have an IRC client handy can jump in immediately via [IRC webchat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=pelican&uio=d4). Because of differing time zones, you may not get an immediate response to your question, but please be patient and stay logged into IRC â€” someone will almost always respond. If for some reason you cannot stay in the IRC channel long enough to wait for an answer to your question, you can later review the [Pelican IRC logs](https://botbot.me/freenode/pelican/) at your leisure to see if someone has answered your question.

If you are unable to resolve your issue or if you have a feature request, please refer to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/issues).

Refer to the [How to Contribute](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/contribute.html) documentation and our [[Git Tips]] page for more details.
